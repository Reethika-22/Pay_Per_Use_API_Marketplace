# Pay Per Use API Marketplace

🚀 A **Web3-based Blockchain** application that enables a secure and transparent **Pay-Per-Use API Marketplace**. It uses **smart contracts** to allow developers to publish APIs and consumers to access them on a usage-based model.
Like we use the montly subcriptions. Even though we are not using them daily in a month still we are paying for months or years. We thought that to charge the subscription for the usage limit. 

The  cost will be reduced.
No wastage of the subscription.
The unnecessary charges will deduced.

## Problem:

APIs today force users into monthly subscriptions — even if you only need a few calls.
No fair “pay-per-use” model using crypto micro-payments.

## Solution:

Marketplace where developers list APIs → users pay ALGO per call → call triggers payment → API result returned → no subscription needed.
